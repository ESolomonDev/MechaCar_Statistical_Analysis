 - Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
	The variables in this data set that appear to have the most non-random effect on MPG are Ground Clearance and Vehicle Length.  In other words Ground Clearance and Vehicle Length seem to have the most significant impact on the MPG.

 - Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
	The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero, there is a significant relationship between 2 independent variables (Vehicle length and ground clearance) and the dependent variable (mpg).

 - Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
